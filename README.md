# resolventchannel
The following matlab codes are used for the resolvent analysis of turbulent channel flow at Re_tau = 182. The scripts are run using chebfun suites; therefore, chebfun must be downloaded from https://www.chebfun.org before running any code These matlab scripts should be run to derive the following plots.

\item final5.png Color contour plot of streamwise velocity fluctuations from the most energetic resolvent mode at $(\lambda^+_x,\lambda^+_z,c) = (1000 ,100, 10)$

The following is a short description of each 

The mean velocity profile of the turbulent channel flow is obtained from https://turbulence.oden.utexas.edu and is in Re180.txt

The codes are derived using the chebfun suites, and therefore, to run each code
