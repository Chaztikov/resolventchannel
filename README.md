# resolventchannel
The following matlab codes are used for the resolvent analysis of turbulent channel flow at Re_tau = 182. The scripts are run using chebfun suites; therefore, chebfun must be downloaded from https://www.chebfun.org before running any code These matlab scripts should be run to derive the following plots. 


The following is a short description of each 

The mean velocity profile of the turbulent channel flow is obtained from https://turbulence.oden.utexas.edu and is in Re180.txt

The codes are derived using the chebfun suites, and therefore, to run each code
